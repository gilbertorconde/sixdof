//! A dependency-free client for the spacenavd input daemon.
//!
//! spacenavd owns the 6-degree-of-freedom device — detection, calibration,
//! dead zones, axis inversion, LEDs — and publishes events on a UNIX socket.
//! This crate speaks that socket protocol directly: no C library, no unsafe
//! code, nothing but `std`.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let mut client = sixdof::Client::connect()?;
//! client.set_name("my-app")?;
//! loop {
//!     match client.read_blocking()? {
//!         sixdof::Event::Motion(m) => println!("{:?} {:?}", m.translate, m.rotate),
//!         other => println!("{other:?}"),
//!     }
//! }
//! # Ok::<(), sixdof::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Without the daemon running there is no socket to open and [`Client::connect`]
//! fails; treat that as an ordinary state and retry.

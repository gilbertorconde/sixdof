# sixdof

A small, dependency-free Rust client for 6-degree-of-freedom input devices —
SpaceMouse, SpaceNavigator, Spaceball and friends — on Unix.

It talks to [spacenavd], the free daemon that owns the device — detection,
calibration, dead zones, per-device configuration — and publishes events on a
UNIX socket. A client just opens that socket and reads.

```rust
// `Source::connect` when either route will do; `Client` for the daemon alone.
let mut client = sixdof::Client::connect()?;
client.set_name("my-app")?;
client.set_event_mask(sixdof::EventMask::DEFAULT)?;

loop {
    match client.read_blocking()? {
        sixdof::Event::Motion(m) => println!("{:?} {:?}", m.translate, m.rotate),
        sixdof::Event::Button { index, pressed } => println!("button {index} {pressed}"),
        other => println!("{other:?}"),
    }
}
```

## What it does

- Speaks the daemon's protocol directly over `/var/run/spnav.sock`
  (`SPNAV_SOCKET`, then `socket = <path>` in `/etc/spnavrc`, then the default).
- Negotiates protocol version 1 and falls back to version 0 against an older
  daemon, where events still decode but requests are unavailable.
- Blocking (`read_blocking`) and non-blocking (`poll`) reads, plus
  `as_raw_fd` for `select`/`poll`/`epoll` loops.
- Queries the connected device: name, path, axis and button counts, USB id.
- Reads and writes the daemon's settings — global and per-axis sensitivity,
  dead zones, axis inversion, axis and button mapping, button actions, key
  emulation, LED, device grab, repeat interval — and can save them to its
  configuration file.
- Falls back to the Magellan protocol over the display server, which is what
  3Dconnexion's own driver speaks (`magellan` feature, one dependency:
  [x11rb]). `Source::connect` takes whichever route answers.
- No C library and no unsafe code; no dependencies at all with the default
  feature set.

```rust
let mut config = client.config();
config.set_axis_sensitivity([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5])?;
config.set_led(sixdof::LedMode::On)?;
config.save()?;
# Ok::<(), sixdof::Error>(())
```

## What it does not do

- No Windows or macOS backend.
- No daemon-less path: without a daemon running, `connect` fails and the
  caller is expected to retry.
